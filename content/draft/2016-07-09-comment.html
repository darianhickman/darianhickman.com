title: 'Random Epiphany:  America is for dreamers with ambition.'
---

America is designed for most to fail. &nbsp; And that culture is a good thing. &nbsp; America is THE country to pursue your dream if you want to be an A-list actor, if you want to build the most advanced technology in the world. If you want to be an internet entpreneur and be the next Bill Gates, the Zuckerberg, the next Tom Cruise. <br /><br />America's most useful blindspot is that millions will try and fail. &nbsp;If none of these dreams matter to you, there are a lot of countries better designed for optimizing every day life. &nbsp;Most of them are in Europe. &nbsp;But there's also New Zealand, Australia, Mauritius, some Southeast Asian countries.
